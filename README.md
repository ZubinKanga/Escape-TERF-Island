**Escape-TERF-Island**

Ableton Live patch for Escape TERF Island â€“ using ROLI (project partner) devices (LUMI keyboards and touchpads). The session uses MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) in combination with the ROLI devices and bespoke sounds to allow the performer to alter the sounds through touch sensors on the keys.
